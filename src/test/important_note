The TestLoadPlayist requires specific files to exist for the tests to work,
but we opted to gitignore them, so if you want to run the tests, use the program to generate save files and then use those

The test folder can be run all at once, but if you run it out of order, sometimes tests won't run properly,
since they depend on previous test outputs, assuming you haven't run any test yet
